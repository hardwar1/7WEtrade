                      market
                      in the world. Whether you sell EUR 100 to buy US dollars at the airport or a bank exchanges 100
                      million US dollars for Japanese yen with another bank, both are FOREX deals. The players on the
                      FOREX market range from huge financial organizations, managing billions, to individuals trading a
                      few hundred dollars.
